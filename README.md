In this project, I have used different machine learning algorithms to check whether a person is vaccinated or not using sci-kit libraries from python.
**Vaccines** are the cornerstone of modern medicines, playing a pivotal role in safeguarding public health and preventing the spread of infection diseases. 
These biological agents, typically composed of weekend or inactivated pathogens or their components, stimulate the immune system to recognize and defend
against specific infections.
Vaccines have been instrumental in eradicating or controlling once-devasating diseases such as polio, smallpox, and measles. Beyond individual protection,
widespread vaccination contributes to the concept of herd immunity, indirectly shielding vulnarable populations who may be unable to receive vaccines. 

The development and deployment of vaccines involves rigorous scientific research, testing, and regulatory processes processes to ensure safety and efficiency.
In the face of emerging health threats, vaccines serve as powerful tools to mitigate the impact of infectious diseases, enhance global health security, and 
foster resilient communities. Public awareness, education, and equitable access to vaccines are crucial components of successful vaccination campaigns, 
promoting a collective effort to build immunity and protect the well-being of community world-wide.
